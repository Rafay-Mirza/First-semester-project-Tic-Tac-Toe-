# First-semester-project-Tic-Tac-Toe-

A console-based Tic Tac Toe game in C++ featuring Player vs Player and Player vs Computer modes with basic AI, colored symbols, and score tracking.

# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮 (C++)

## 📖 Project Description
This is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** developed in **C++** as a computer programming project.  
The game supports both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs Computer** modes.  
It includes a **basic AI opponent**, **colored player symbols**, **score tracking**, and an option to **play multiple rounds**.

The game is designed to demonstrate the use of **structures, arrays, functions, conditional statements, loops, and basic AI logic** in C++.

## 🎯 Features
- Player vs Player mode
- Player vs Computer mode (AI opponent)
- Smart computer moves (win, block, center priority)
- Colored symbols for players
- 3×3 interactive game board
- Score tracking for both players
- Replay option after each game
- Clear and user-friendly console interface

---

## 🕹 Game Rules
- The game is played on a **3×3 grid**
- Player 1 chooses a symbol (`x`, `o`, or `#`)
- Player 2 (or computer) uses a different symbol
- Players take turns selecting a position (1–9)
- The first player to align **three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal** wins
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a **draw**

## 🤖 Computer AI Logic
The computer player follows these rules:
1. Wins the game if a winning move is available
2. Blocks the opponent’s winning move
3. Takes the center cell if available
4. Selects the first available empty cell

This provides a simple but effective AI for beginners.
